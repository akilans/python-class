I spent most of my life in London, now back in Wales, the Government policy is the correct approach, this it isn't meant to be an everyone back to work policy. It's still an 'if it is safe to do so', policy. Even to the point of workers choice, not bosses.
Basically they’re saying drive but really they want you to cycle in. Never mind parking in London is a nightmare and not everyone has/wants to ride a bike.
The Fallen London games all have that same feel to their OSTs, so I believe it. I've dropped off both of the games, Sunless Seas and Sunless Skies, due to a combination of mildly grating creative decisions and not caring for the gameplay, but I'd never fault that team's OSTs.

Members took a trip to the London Albert hall 
That is literally tens of thousands of London’s workers, crammed on to reduced services.

I'd argue that depends where you are. Aberdeen is cheaper than London (obviously an extreme example). Have you got any evidence to show that things are more expensive on the whole? From my experience (limited admittedly) there wasn't much difference
Achaw London chlna mere sath

Victoria Beckham has been forced to deny rumours that she returned to her London home in recent weeks, by posting ‘proof’ on social media. 
‘Finally, a virus got me.’ Scientist who fought Ebola and HIV reflects on facing death from COVID-19. You live in a routine from syringe to infusion and you hope you make it,” Peter Piot says about his time in a London hospital

Gangs of London is a classssss little series 
Fun fact: While in London, Jared visited Madame Tussauds to look at his dummy, and they both came out.
Was in London 03March for Chelsea v LFC. Practiced SocialDistancing on the tube even then,moving carriages if someone coughed(and they did). My old mate Bob, a CFC fan, understood and followed me. It was simply Common Sense. Stay Alert.

This time last year I was in London, then to Baden Württemberg to visit a friend, then went to Brussels for work. All I’ve done this May is play Animal Crossing and contribute to back problems by sitting at my computer on my uncomfortable chair all day.
London public toilets brace for disruption
Gangs of london hayali bir yer yapmış :d Gotham' a kafa tutar mı?
How many people do you know who’ve had it?Those who haven’t will get it if lockdown is eased when danger is still real. London obviously got hit early. I know a dozen who’ve had it. Some hospitalised. Thankfully none as far as ICU. It’s unpleasant. But it’s deadly for our parents

You maybe a nice gentle person but Spatial unawareness sort of sums up most Londoners thinking about the rest of the UK. I come from rural Ireland, lived in the Welsh valleys, Cardiff, Southampton (twice), Watford, parts of London and now Kent so feel kinda qualified to comment.
Even New York's finest know what time it is. Big love to the NY cabs from the London cabs, appreciate the good citizen taxi drivers you have sir! 
Kandi really be on ft from London to Toronto 
It was already there. Let's not forget London 2012 and all that shit.
If anyone thinks they aren’t putting the economy before lives in the most gratuitous fashion I just can’t believe it. Seeing the tube from London this morning makes me worry about two weeks from now

Apart from Brian Moore’s head looking uncannily like London planetarium. Did he once say that “David Coleman was a horrible person to work with, as he was always shouting at people”. ?

What people don’t seem to understand are a few key points: - We’re a ridiculously densely populated country which increases transmission likelihood and hence why even more densely populated areas like London get hit the worst. Density prevents distancing

When I was a young kid I went to London and supposedly sat on the tube next to Arthur Scargill. Apparently he smiled at me, but that was probably a sign of fear from sensing who the real revolutionary was in there.

How wonderful that France’s new slogan Sauvez des Vies, Restez Prudents, can plausibly be translated as Save Lives, Stay Alert! London seems to be marching more in time with Paris and Dublin than Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast!
