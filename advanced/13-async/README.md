### Multithreading & MultiProcessing

- Multithreading is when a processor can run multiple threads at the same time. Each thread runs a process.
- Multithreading uses a single process with multiple code segments to increase computing power.
- Multithreading also aims to increase the use of a single core by using thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism.
- Threads share resources with one another within the process they belong to. For example global variable
- Multiprocessing is when a system can run multiple processors in parallel. Each processor can run one or more threads.
- Multiprocessing uses two or more CPUs to increase computing power.
- Multiprocessing systems include multiple complete processing units in one or more cores.
